# To-do App

This React-based To-Do List application enables users to effectively manage their daily tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed with a strikethrough effect, edit existing ones, or delete tasks when no longer needed. The interface is intuitive and designed to keep task management simple and clutter-free.
To enhance usability, the app includes input validation â€” preventing users from entering empty tasks or duplicate entries. This ensures that the task list remains meaningful and organized.
React's state management is used to dynamically update the task list in real time.
Overall, the app offers a clean and efficient solution for tracking daily to-dos with basic error handling and task validation built-in.
